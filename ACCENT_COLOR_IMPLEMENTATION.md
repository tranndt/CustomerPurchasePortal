# Accent Color Implementation

This document describes the implementation of consistent accent colors across the admin components to match the colors defined in AdminHome.

## Color Scheme

The following accent colors are used throughout the admin portal components:

1. **Order Fulfillment: Blue (#3b82f6)**
   - Used for page title, buttons, tab highlights, and action elements
   - Creates a consistent blue theme throughout the Order Fulfillment component

2. **Inventory Management: Green (#22c55e)**
   - Used for page title, buttons, tab highlights, and action elements
   - Creates a consistent green theme throughout the Inventory Management component

3. **Customer Feedback/Reviews: Purple (#a259ec)**
   - Used for page title, buttons, tab highlights, and action elements
   - Creates a consistent purple theme throughout the Reviews component

4. **Support Tickets: Yellow (#ffc107)**
   - Used for page title, buttons, tab highlights, and action elements
   - Creates a consistent yellow theme throughout the Ticket Manager component
   - Uses dark text for better contrast on yellow backgrounds

## Implementation Details

The accent colors were applied to the following elements in each component:

- Page title text color
- Tab active state background and border
- Tab hover state text color
- Action button background colors
- Refresh button background and shadow
- Input focus border colors

Each component now has a unified color scheme that matches its corresponding card in the AdminHome component, providing a cohesive and consistent user experience across the admin portal.

## Benefits
