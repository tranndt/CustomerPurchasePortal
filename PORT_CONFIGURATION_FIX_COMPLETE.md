# Port Configuration Fix - Complete

## Issue
After deploying to Render, the application was showing "Welcome to the Purchase Portal API" instead of the React frontend. This indicated that the Express API service was binding to the main port (10000) instead of Django.

## Root Cause
The start.sh script was starting three services:
1. Flask sentiment service (background)
2. Express API service (background) 
3. Django application (foreground)

However, the Express service was binding to the main PORT environment variable (10000 on Render), which prevented Django from binding to the same port.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated start.sh script
- Modified Flask service to run on internal port 5000: `PORT=5000 python app.py &`
- Modified Express service to run on internal port 3000: `PORT=3000 node app.js &`
- Left Django to bind to the main PORT variable for external access

### 2. Updated Express app.js
- Changed hardcoded port from `const port = 3030` to `const port = process.env.PORT || 3030`
- This allows the Express service to use the PORT environment variable when set

### 3. Updated Flask app.py
- Added `import os` and modified to use `port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 5002))`
- This allows the Flask service to use the PORT environment variable when set

## Expected Result
- Flask sentiment service: Internal port 5000
- Express API service: Internal port 3000
- Django application: Main port (10000 on Render) serving React frontend

## Database Status
The deployment logs show:
- ✅ 151 products loaded successfully
- ✅ 3 demo users created (demo_customer, demo_admin, demo_support)
- ✅ Database setup working correctly
- ✅ Login endpoint should now be accessible at `/djangoapp/login`

## Demo Users Available
- Username: `demo_customer`, Password: `password123`
- Username: `demo_admin`, Password: `password123`  
- Username: `demo_support`, Password: `password123`

## Files Modified
- `/deploy-scripts/start.sh` - Service port configuration
- `/server/database/app.js` - Express port configuration
- `/server/djangoapp/microservices/app.py` - Flask port configuration

This fix ensures Django serves the React frontend on the main port while other services run on internal ports.
