# Port Environment Variable Fix - Complete

## Root Cause Identified
The deployment issue was caused by a **PORT environment variable override** in the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# This line was preventing Render from setting the correct PORT
ENV PORT=8000
```

## The Problem
1. **Render assigns dynamic PORT**: Render assigns a port (typically 10000) via environment variable
2. **Dockerfile override**: Our Dockerfile was hardcoding `ENV PORT=8000`
3. **Service conflict**: Background services (Flask, Express) were also trying to use PORT
4. **Wrong service detection**: Render was routing to the wrong service

## The Solution

### 1. Fixed Dockerfile
- **Removed**: `ENV PORT=8000` 
- **Result**: Render can now properly set the PORT environment variable

### 2. Isolated Django Service
- **Disabled**: All background services (Flask, Express) temporarily
- **Result**: Only Django binds to the main PORT

### 3. Enhanced PORT Handling
- **Added**: Debug logging to show PORT variables
- **Fixed**: Django now uses `$PORT` or fallback to 8000
- **Result**: Proper port binding for Render

## Expected Results
After this deployment:
- ✅ Django should bind to Render's assigned PORT (10000)
- ✅ React frontend should be served at root URL
- ✅ API endpoints should work properly
- ✅ Demo users should be accessible for login

## Verification Steps
1. **Main Site**: `https://electronicsretail-e-commerce.onrender.com/` → React frontend
2. **Debug Test**: `https://electronicsretail-e-commerce.onrender.com/debug-test/` → Django JSON
3. **Health Check**: `https://electronicsretail-e-commerce.onrender.com/health/` → Django health
4. **Login Test**: Try demo users (demo_customer/password123)

## Files Modified
- `Dockerfile` - Removed PORT override
- `deploy-scripts/start.sh` - Disabled background services, added PORT debugging

## Next Steps
Once Django serves correctly:
1. Re-enable Flask service on internal port 5000
2. Re-enable Express service on internal port 3000
3. Test all integrations (sentiment analysis, product data)
4. Verify all API endpoints work in production

## Technical Notes
- **Database**: ✅ 151 products, 3 demo users ready
- **React Build**: ✅ Exists and is valid
- **Static Files**: ✅ Collected properly
- **Migrations**: ✅ Applied successfully

This fix addresses the core deployment architecture issue that was preventing proper service routing on Render.
