# Admin Home Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the refactoring done to the AdminHome component to align with the updated design system and color scheme.

## Changes Made

### 1. Gradient Cards

All admin cards now use gradient backgrounds instead of solid colors with border tops:

- **Order Fulfillment**: Updated to use a blue gradient (#3b82f6 to #1e40af) from lighter to darker
- **Inventory Management**: Updated to use a green gradient (#22c55e to #166534) from lighter to darker
- **Support Tickets**: Updated to use an amber gradient (#ffc107 to #b45309) from lighter to darker
- **Customer Feedback**: Updated to use a purple gradient (#a259ec to #7e22ce) from lighter to darker

### 2. Card Text Styling

- Changed the text color within cards to white (#ffffff) for better contrast against the gradient backgrounds
- Used a slightly lighter shade (#f8fafc) for the description text to maintain readability
- Icons are now white for better visibility against the gradient backgrounds

### 3. Admin Dashboard Title

- Updated the gradient for the "Admin Dashboard" title to use a more complementary purple-blue gradient (#a855f7 to #4f46e5)

## Design Improvements

1. **Visual Consistency**: All admin components now use the same design language with consistent gradient direction (lighter top-left to darker bottom-right)

2. **Improved Accessibility**: Higher contrast between text and backgrounds makes the interface more readable

3. **Visual Hierarchy**: The gradient backgrounds create a more sophisticated look that draws attention to each section of the admin interface

4. **Amber for Support Tickets**: Changed from yellow to a more sophisticated amber gradient that matches the TicketManager component

5. **Full Card Gradient**: Replaced the top border accent with full card gradients for a more immersive and modern appearance
