## üöÄ Deployment on Render

This application can be deployed on [Render](https://render.com) using Docker.

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Create a new Web Service on Render**
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Select "Docker" as the environment
   - Use the main branch for deployment
   - Set the port to 8000 (main Django application port)

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Add all required environment variables from `.env.example`
   - Make sure to set `DEBUG=False` for production
   - Add any necessary API keys

3. **External Services**
   - For MongoDB, you'll need to provision an external MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas
   - Add the MongoDB connection string as an environment variable

4. **Scaling**
   - Start with the Standard plan for better performance
   - Free tier may experience cold starts that could affect service

### Monitoring

- Use the Render dashboard to monitor logs
- Set up health checks for each service
