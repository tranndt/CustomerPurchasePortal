# Project Report: Fullstack Developer Capstone

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application designed to showcase a comprehensive e-commerce platform. It includes a Django backend for managing data and business logic, and a React frontend for a modern, user-friendly interface. The application demonstrates the integration of multiple technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Features

### Backend (Django)

1. **Product Management**:

   - Products are loaded from a CSV file (`Products.csv`) into the Django database.
   - Missing fields are automatically populated with realistic data (e.g., descriptions, stock levels).
   - Management commands (`load_products`, `list_products`, `check_products`) are available for data handling and verification.

2. **API Endpoints**:

   - RESTful APIs are implemented to serve product data to the frontend.
   - Endpoints are optimized for performance and security.

3. **Database**:

   - SQLite is used for development, with models for `Product` and `Review`.
   - Relationships between models are properly defined to ensure data integrity.

4. **Microservices**:

   - A sentiment analysis microservice is included to analyze product reviews.
   - Dockerized services ensure scalability and ease of deployment.

### Frontend (React)

1. **Shop Component**:

   - Displays products in a grid layout with responsive design.
   - Product cards include images, names, categories, prices, and stock status.
   - Images are displayed in a square ratio for consistency.

2. **Search and Filter**:

   - Users can search for products and filter by categories.
   - Real-time updates ensure a smooth user experience.

3. **Cart and Checkout**:

   - Users can add products to the cart and proceed to checkout.
   - Cart items are displayed with quantity controls and total price calculation.

4. **Responsive Design**:

   - The application is fully responsive, ensuring usability across devices.

### Deployment

1. **Docker**:

   - Docker Compose is used to manage multiple services (Django, React, microservices).
   - Simplifies deployment and ensures consistency across environments.

2. **Development Servers**:

   - Django backend and React frontend servers are configured for local development.
   - Commands to start servers are documented for ease of use.

## Highlights

1. **Data Handling**:

   - Enhanced CSV loading with BOM character handling.
   - Automated data population for missing fields.

2. **Custom Management Commands**:

   - `load_products`: Loads products from the CSV file.
   - `list_products`: Lists all products in the database.
   - `check_products`: Verifies data quality and provides statistics.

3. **Frontend Improvements**:

   - Adjusted product card image ratio to square using CSS (`aspect-ratio: 1 / 1`).
   - Ensured product card height accommodates content without overflow.

4. **Documentation**:

   - Comprehensive README and setup guides are provided.
   - Summary files document key changes and commands.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django, SQLite, Python
- **Frontend**: React, CSS, JavaScript
- **Microservices**: Flask, Docker
- **Tools**: Docker Compose, npm, Python management commands

## Future Enhancements

1. **Scalability**:

   - Migrate the database to PostgreSQL for production.
   - Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure).

2. **Features**:

   - Add user authentication and authorization.
   - Implement payment gateway integration for checkout.

3. **Performance**:

   - Optimize API endpoints for faster response times.
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to build a full-stack application with a focus on functionality, usability, and scalability. It serves as a strong foundation for further development and deployment in a production environment.
